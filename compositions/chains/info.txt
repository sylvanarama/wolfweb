notes: This new work, written for guitarist Adrian Verdejo, explores the idea of memory and the obsessive nature of repetitive thought. Memories, like neuro-loops, tend to recur whether we want them or not.  The archeology of our minds. The persistent building of trauma-layers that occur in many guises; sometimes clear, sometimes obscured, or warped, and often twisted with time. Like great chains we drag behind us, memory can be at times uplifting and inspiring or other times unveil the terrifying vistas of a bleak sub conscious horror.
